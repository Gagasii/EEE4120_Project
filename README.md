# Median and Sobel filter
The FPGA implementation of a median and sobel filter for assisted parking systems

# features
*  **High Performance Computing**:Reliable and adaptable programmable chip that ensures efficient operations
*  **Scalability**: Implementation designed to support additional, more complex features.
*  **Efficient Image Processing**: Uses a pipeline for parallel execution, enabling fast and efficient image processing.
# Hardware Requirements
* Xilinx FPGA development board
  
# Software Required
* Xilinx Vivado

# How it works
1. **Median Filter**: Smooths the image by removing noise while preserving edges.
2. **Sobel Filter**: Detects edges by calculating gradients in the image

# Futere enhancements
* Adding surport for additional filters, such as Gaussian blur.
* Integration with camera module for live video processing.
